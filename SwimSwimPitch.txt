In Swim Swim Swim, the player controls a dolphin and traverses a procedurally generated ocean.
The player’s goal is to destroy floating junk in the ocean with sonic attacks.
If the player reaches the end of a level then they unlock the next level.

Core mechanic:
Swipe objects on screen then press two fingers to screen, now your sonar attack will destroy each object in time with the music.
Sonar blasts create notes which become musical melodies.
Sonic attacks can stack- hovering over junk will create a longer and louder sonic attack which is more powerful but will also create a longer note (slower attack speed).

Level design:
Casual scale: create 1 level. incremental challenges and a final boss. 10 minutes to complete. Put on app store for free.
Larger scale: create 3-5 levels with different aesthetics and themed enemies. 30 mins-1 hour to complete. Put on app store for a few dollars.
